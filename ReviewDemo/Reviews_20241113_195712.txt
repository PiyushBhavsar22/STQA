Review: Very premium videography, haven't experimented with normal photography yet.It feels very premium and I don't have any issues with the bezels as others were saying it has big bezels.Heating is very minimal. Even my previous phones, including the Samsung M51 and iPhone 11, used to heat up this much. I'd say it's still better than them in terms of heating. I think many reviews are just exaggerating the heating issue. Even I had second thoughts before buying it due to those exaggerated reviews, but so far, it's worth it. (Maybe Exynos ones heat up more?? )I love the Samsung AI, and the circle to search is very beneficial for me.I even played PUBG, and as expected, it heated up a little, but still not more than my previous phones. The heating was minimal even while playing PUBG.Normal users who usually just surf the internet, use social media, watch YouTube videos, shop online, and want a good camera (especially for videography because the stabilization is unreal) can definitely go for this!!

Review: I had ordered the S23 FE 5G phone yesterday, and it was delivered to me a day earlier, which was a very good delivery experience. However, I encountered an issue with it. I checked the product specifications on Amazon, and it was mentioned in the details that the phone uses a Snapdragon Qualcomm chipset, which is the one I wanted, as it is available internationally. Since it was listed on Amazon, I went ahead and purchased it. However, when it was delivered today, there was no mention of the chipset on the box—just that it was the 8 GB, 128 GB variant, which I had purchased. But there were no details about the processor anywhere.When I opened the phone and checked the details through the app, I found that it actually came with an Exynos 2200 chipset, which I definitely did not want. I purchased this phone based on the product description available on Amazon. This is a huge case of misleading customers by selling products in this way. I hope that the customer care representative I spoke to earlier, who informed me that because this was a cash-on-delivery purchase, they can only assist after 72 hours, will resolve the issue smoothly.I have been a long-time customer of Amazon with great experiences, and they have always handled issues very well. I am hoping that they will pay attention to this matter as well and process my refund smoothly.

Review: First Thing to Note: I am not a regular SAMSUNG user. This is my first SAMSUNG phone !Its been almost a week since I am using this phone now and I have been digging into every bit of it.Without wasting any more time. Here's the PRO's and CON'sPRO's==============I bought this phone under 44K. So what do you get after spending so much ?1. I have hardly seen any phone in the market which provides 4 Years of OS updates +1 year of security update. You get total 5 Years of update with this.2. IP68 rating. I have tried searching for phones with this flagship feature under 44K but didn't find any.3. No gimmick camera's. You get 3 lenses  50 MP Main, 12 MP ultrawide, 8 MP 3x optical which captures clear image up to 10x digital zoom after that you will see the image getting blurry. Max you can zoom is 30x. Selfie camera is 10 MP. Don't compare camera basis on megapixels. It all depends on processing.One might say that Realme 12 pro+ has 120x zoom periscope lens under 25k but that is the only usable camera lens in that phone. Other lenses are not up to the mark. It feels like Realme invested all the money on that one periscope lens. We don't always capture zoomed pictures. If I am buying a good camera phone I would expect that all the lenses are equally competitive and produce quality images.I am impressed with all the 3 lenses SAMSUNG has provided in this phone. It produces clear images. If you do not like vibrant color photos we have an option to disable the scene optimizer. I have noticed it captures more realistic colors. All the 3 camera sensors on this phone are from SAMSUNG. If you need more details google it.Video: You can record 4K from Selfie camera and up to 8K from rear camera. Again a Flagship spec. You might not practically always record in 8K but we do have 4K OR Full HD. Stabilization in Video is awesome. I would say photos are better compare to video.4. In hand feel: This depends on person to person. For me slight thicker phones are better than slim phone. My previous phone was iqoo7. Larger in screen size but slimmer. Trust me I never dared to use that without cover in day to day life. Slimer phones are attractive in looks but can slip from hands easily.Holding this phone even without cover feels confident.5.We get wireless charging if that is something you prefer. I don't use it.6.Dual speakers support with Dolby audio. Display peak brightness is 1450 nits. Easily visible in sunlight. There are some brands which advertise peak nits as 2400. That's a gimmick. In actual practical experience they don't compare anywhere near S23 FE. Check you tube videos related if you need more info on peak brightness. Display can go up to 120 Hz.7. Gorilla Glass 5 protection with Aluminum frame. Again a flagship experience. You hardly get a metal frame in this segment. Maybe we will get more in the future from other brands as well.8. One UI 6.0. Has a lot of features packed. Overall I liked it but not the best in the market. There are some preinstalled SAMSUNG apps which you can uninstall. If they can't be uninstalled we get an option to disable the them permanently. Search feature in One UI is amazing. It can search every bit of settings from app drawer. Has color pallet feature. You can customize you lock screen. some good SAMSUNG widgets.Con's:=========The biggest problem on this device is the 4500 mah battery. I really feel SAMSUNG should have provided at least 5000 mah. With 120 Hz refresh rate on I get hardly 4 hrs of screentimeTo overcome this I have been using this phone at 60 hz and light performance profile enabled which slightly underclocks the device. It's ok for me as I am a normal average user.I get 6 hrs of SOT with 5 % battery still remaining. So good for me. I didn't activate power saving mode while testing this. So maybe it can last for more 30 - 40 minutes.If you are a heavy user this phone is not for you. Gaming works fine but battery will drain faster.

Review: I recently purchased the Samsung S23 FE, and I’m thrilled with it! The display is stunning, offering vibrant colors and sharp clarity that make everything from browsing to gaming a pleasure. The performance is smooth and fast, handling all my apps and multitasking without any hiccups.The camera quality is impressive too; I’ve taken some great photos, even in low light. Battery life is solid, easily lasting a full day with my regular usage. Overall, this phone offers amazing value for the features it provides. Highly recommend it to anyone looking for a reliable and high-performing device!

Review: I have had straighttalk for 10+ years and my two complaints are bad customer service and hassle of switching to a new phone. I recently purchased a fully unlocked phone and it did not work and had to return. I was concerned when I purchased this, but the description said factory unlocked and for use with all carriers. I received my phone today, opened it, and then saw the slip on paper telling me to read before I broke the seal....too late. The paper stated that it was not compatible with AT&T, Verizon, ect. Needless to say, I was furious because the description that I read over multiple times told me otherwise. It stated that it was only for use with T-Moble. Fast forward and since I already opened it, i put my Verizon SIM card in it and it works great. I am happy with the phone. Not sure why the FE is so much cheaper, but I had an S9, so this is a huge upgrade. I hope this helps other Straighttalk Customers in choosing a phone.

Review: I was scared because I had never bought a phone online. The phone is exactly as described and is so smooth. I already bought a case and a screen protector. I used to own an iPhone but I began to dislike the brand and decided to buy a Samsung. So far I'm happy with my purchase. It is, indeed, unlocked. I'm from Ecuador and I didn't have any problem putting my SIM card.
