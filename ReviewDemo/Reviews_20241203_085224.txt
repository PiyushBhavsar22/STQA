Review: Good machine with great build quality and functionality specially for bachelors. It properly washes the clothes with very low sound. It is good for those who are living in cities and have taken machines on 800-1k rent. Go for it with EMI; your EMI will be the same as your rent.

Review: Machine is working good as expected but if you have never used a fully automatic machine like me this might take a couple of washes to understand the features, also one thing to mention that all fully automatic machine no matter which company rotate in same manner in washing mode one round clockwise one anti clockwise the semi automatic one rotates clockwise for 3-4 minutes and anticlockwise 3-4 minute but fully automatic moves differently as mentioned also the noise level is extremely low which is very good ,and wash quality is also very good one thing to note that the rinse mode is a little bit tricky to understand if you're manually rinsing and also the heater thing ,the heater takess too much time to heat and consumes a lot of electricity I'll suggest you to use your gezzeer and add the hot water manually through pipe this is the only drawback I don't know about other machine how there inbuilt heaters work or how much time it takes but this one take a lot

Review: Machine is very good and easy to use. Other companies provide extra features which are not necessarily required in normal life and price of that feature includes the cost of machine. Panasonic understand Indian customer usage requirement and make this type of budget friendly machine.

Review: I had a Samsung before this which was more convenient to use. However i have no complaints with this Panasonic either.The sound is quite less, wash quality is good too, I did the installation myself because they didn't send the person on the next day as advertised. Later the person came after a week when i booked the request. Didn't know I was supposed to do that.Water level indicator is a weird one. It has level 1-10, makes no sense. Ideally it should just have 3 levels, low medium and high based on the amount of clothes put in it.Overall 4/5, I've deducted one point mainly because of the installation drama and that I was unnecessarily sold a water softener because my machine would otherwise get damaged. The water tds level in my flat is about 200. Google says upto 500 is fine to use. But what do I know? I'm just a dumb customer.
